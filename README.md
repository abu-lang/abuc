# AbU compiler

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/abu-lang/abuc/blob/main/LICENSE)

A compiler for the AbU language.

`abuc` is a compiler translating programs written with AbU DSL [`abudsl`](https://github.com/abu-lang/abudsl) to different platforms. At the moment, the compiler supports the following target languages/architectures: *Go* code, *amd64* executables and *arm64* executables.

### Requirements
An [adequate](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy) version of the Go language is required for installing and using `abuc` (it calls the Go language compiler in its execution).

### Installation
`abuc` can be installed with the go install command:
```
$ go install github.com/abu-lang/abuc@latest
```

## Usage
```
Usage: abuc [-ivh] [-o <output>] [-s <system>] [-t <target>] [-c <config>] [<source>]
  <source>                 filename of the source code to compile
  -o, --output <output>    output filename for the compiled source
  -s, --system <system>    target operating system [default: the operating system where abuc was installed]
  -t, --target <target>    target language or architecture [default: the architecture where abuc was installed]
  -c, --config <config>    configuration file for <target>
  -i, --intermediate       intermediate (single node) .abu files are generated
  -v, --version            print version information and exit
  -h, --help               print usage

Available values for <target>
  go       compile into 'Go' code
  amd64    compile into 'amd64' executable
  arm64    compile into 'arm64' executable

Available values for <system>
  run the following command to see a list of possible values for <system>:
  go tool dist list | grep 'amd64\|arm64' | sed -e 's/\/.*//' | sed -nr '$!N;/^(.*)\n\1$/!P;D'
```
If `<output>` ends with a directory separator, the output is placed in the directory indicated by `<output>` (the directory is created if it does not exist).

If `<source>` is not specified, the `abudsl` input is read from the standard input. If provided, the `<source>` option is to be specified as the last argument.

### Examples

Consider the following very simple `abudsl` program `test.abu`:
```
# AbU devices definition.

dev1 : "A first test device" {
    logical string name = "dev1"
    physical output string test = ""
    physical input boolean activate
} has notifyPeers

dev2 : "A second test device" {
    logical string name = "dev2"
    physical output string test = ""
    physical input boolean activate
} has notifyPeers

dev3 : "A third test device" {
    logical string name = "dev3"
    physical output string test = ""
    physical input boolean activate
} has notifyPeers

# AbU rules definition.

rule notifyPeers
    on activate
    for all (this.activate == true)
        do ext.test = this.name
```
We can compile such program to *Go* code by typing:
```
$ abuc -o testgo -t go test.abu
```
The command outputs three *Go* source code files `testgo-dev1.go`, `testgo-dev2.go` and `testgo-dev3.go` containing (the translation of) device *dev1* code, device *dev2* code and device *dev3* code, respectively. All files contain (the translation of) the rule *notifyPeers* code. <br><br>

Consider now the `abudsl` example program `raspberry-pi.abu`, that you can find in the [raspberry-pi](https://github.com/abu-lang/abudsl/tree/master/examples/raspberry-pi) directory of the `abudsl` repository. We can compile such program to *arm64* executables by typing:
```
$ abuc -o testraspberry -s linux -t arm64 -c config.json raspberry-pi.abu
```
in the `raspberry-pi` directory.
The command outputs two *arm64* executables `testraspberry-controls` and `testraspberry-wheel`, that can be directly deployed on the Raspberry Pi.
