# AbU compiler

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/abu-lang/abuc/blob/main/LICENSE)

A compiler for the AbU language.

`abuc` is a compiler translating programs written with AbU DSL [`abudsl`](https://github.com/abu-lang/abudsl) to different platforms. At the moment, the compiler supports the following target languages/architectures: *Golang* code, *amd64* executables and *arm64* executables; and the following operating systems: *Linux* based systems.

## Installation
The compiler can be retrieved with go get:
```
$ go get github.com/abu-lang/abuc
```

## Usage
```
Usage: abuc [-ivh] [-o <output>] [-s <system>] [-t <target>] [-c <config>] <source>
  <source>                 filename of the source code to compile
  -o, --output <output>    output filename for the compiled source [optional]
  -s, --system <system>    target operating system [optional, default 'linux']
  -t, --target <target>    target language or architecture [optional, default 'amd64']
  -c, --config <config>    configuration file for <target> [optional]
  -i, --intermediate       intermediate (single node) .abu files are generated [optional]
  -v, --version            print version information and exit [optional]
  -h, --help               print usage

Available options for <system>:
  linux    compile into 'Linux' based systems 
  
Available options for <target>:
  go       compile into 'Golang' code
  amd64    compile into 'amd64' executable
  arm64    compile into 'arm64' executable
```

### Examples

Consider the following snippet of an `abudsl` program `test.abu`:
```
# AbU devices definition.

dev1 : "A first test device" {
    # Resources declaration.
    ...
}

dev2 : "A second test device" {
    # Resources declaration.
    ...
}

dev3 : "A third test device" {
    # Resources declaration.
    ...
}
```
We can compile such program to *Golang* code by typing: 
```
$ abuc -o testgo -t go test.abu
```
The command outputs three *Golang* source code file `testgo-dev1.go`, `testgo-dev2.go` and `testgo-dev3.go`. <br><br>

Consider now the `abudsl` example program `raspberry-pi.abu`, that you can find in the [raspberry-pi](https://github.com/abu-lang/abudsl/tree/master/examples/raspberry-pi) folder. We can compile such program to *arm64* executables by typing:
```
$ abuc -o testraspberry -t arm64 -c config.json raspberry-pi.abu
```
The command outputs two *arm64* executables `testraspberry-controls` and `testraspberry-wheel`, that can be directly deployed on the Raspberry Pi.
